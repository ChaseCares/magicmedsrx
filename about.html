		<p class="paragraph"><Lorem>
		Over the years medications have become more advanced, BUT so have the prices. Brand name medications are amongst the top reasons for medication non-adherence, financial burden to patients, and health inequity. Many of these brand name medications seem to only be available to patients who can afford it, excluding those who are uninsured, low income, financially constrained, or even those who have worked their entire lives to be on Medicare, just to find out the medication is not covered or the deductible is too high for them to even consider buying medications that may add years to their life

		<img src="me.jpeg"> <br>I am a practicing clinical pharmacist that is passionate about patient's being able to be on the best therapies that will improve their qualty of life and reduce their chance of mortality. My family is similar to many families across the United States. Both of my parents are amongst the baby boomer generation and are now approaching the Medicare age. My dad worked for the same company for 41 years, 3am to 4pm, before retiring. He has now been retired for 3 short years and pouring his hard earned money into his prescription medications. He has been blessed enough to have received samples of some of his medications to help keep him out of the hospital and at home, enjoying his retirement. Now that he is at the age of Medicare enrollment, sifting through multiple companies to see how to best afford his brand name insulin and other brand name medications, I set out on a quest to evaluate how he could best be served, along with the rest of the nation. This led to the creation of M.A.G.I.C., The Medication Assistance Guide for Improving Care. <br><br><br><br><br>

	<h2 class="subject">What is a patient assistance program (PAP)?</h2>
		<p class="paragraph"><Lorem>
			A patient assistance program is when a drug manufacturer offers their brand's medication for FREE to eliminate financial barriers for qualifying patients. These programs actually send the medication directly to a patient's home for a year. For Medicare patients with fixed incomes, you may qualify for the rest of your life! Are there a lot of these programs? Yes! Why do drug companies offer these programs? I believe there are tax incentives for these multi-billion dollar companies to offer these programs. There are 27+ drug companies that offer PAPs. 
		</p>
	<h2 class="subject">Why have you never heard of PAP?</h2>
		<p class="paragraph"><Lorem>
		 PAP programs are grossly underutilized. Picture these large comapnies offering these programs but patients not knowing they exist due to them being deeply embedded in their websites! What if I told you the majority of even healthcare professionals are unaware of the extent of available programs that are offered? Imagine you're listening to a long advertisement that ends in "Call for Eligibility Details", that is the current state of PAP programs not being transparent.

	<h2 class="subject">What is M.A.G.I.C.?</h2>
		<p class="paragraph"><Lorem>
		M.A.G.I.C. is a comprehensive, fully interactive collection of available patient assistance programs (PAP) for brand name drugs in the United States. It is designed with the patient in mind, attempting to make eligibility criteria as clear as possible. Our mission is to save patients from having to use alternative medications, save patients money, and eliminate inequity that exists in patient care due to cost of brand name medications. M.A.G.I.C. is designed that ANYONE should be able to use the system to at least know whether or not they qualify for a PAP program.
